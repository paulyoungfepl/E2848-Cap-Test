[0.11.2]: https://github.com/pvcaptest/pvcaptest/compare/v0.11.1...v0.11.2
## [0.11.2] - 2023-04-20
### Added
- Adds CI testing across python 3.7 to 3.11 on OSX, Linux, and Windows using Github actions.

### Changed
- Re-organized project root directory to place captest package under a src directory, see PR #83.
- Re-organized the extras for pip installation into optional, test, docs, and all. Updated the installation section of the docs to reflect change.
- Updated installation instructions with links to pandas and conda docs for more information on environments.
- Re-organized installation instructions.
- Changed instructions on creating a conda env for pvcaptest to directly download the env yaml file from the repository rather than the whole repository.
- Clean up RTD configuration, particularly added project directory to PYTHONPATH in the docs build environment, so the docs build against checked out version instead of installed version from conda.
- Updates to documentation to add new modules, remove history section of releases, and remove references to Travis CI.

### Fixed
- Cleaned up issues in tests found after re-implementing CI on other platforms.

[0.11.1]: https://github.com/pvcaptest/pvcaptest/compare/v0.11.0...v0.11.1
## [0.11.1] - 2023-04-09
### Added
- Added new dependencies - colorcet, param
- Added openpyxl as an optional dependency
- Loads bokeh as holoviews extension in captest imports so user doesn't need to

### Changed
- Removed use of hvplot, replaced with holoviews to avoid adding unnecessary dependency. PR #73.

### Fixed
- Typo in the import check of panel

[0.11.0]: https://github.com/pvcaptest/pvcaptest/compare/v0.10.0...v0.11.0
## [0.11.0] - 2023-04-07 [YANKED]
### Added
- Added columngroups module with a ColumnGroups class that extends python
dictionaries to include each column group as an attribute and __repr__ is
formatted for easy reading.
- Created the `loc` and `floc` callables for CapData, which allow easier access to columns of the `data` and `data_filtered` attributes, repsectively. Will replace `view` and `rview` method.
- Added `read_json` function to util module.
- Added `read_yaml` function to util module.
- Added the io module with functions to load data and return instances of CapData containing the loaded data.
- Added the ReportingIrradiance class for calculations of a reporting irradiance that is between the 40th and 60th percentile. `ReportingIrradiance.plot` includes a dashboard type view of the selected and possible reporting irradiance values and method to save possible reporting conditions table to csv.
- Added the `spatial_uncert` and `expanded_uncert` methods. Improvements and testing needed.


### Changed
- Moved group_columns method, series_type, and type definitions from the capdata module to the columngroups module and changed group_columns from a CapData method to a function that returns a ColumnGroups instance.
- Completely refactored the algorithim to determine the reporting irradiance when `irr_bal` is set to True. Now an instance of the new ReportingIrradiance class is created and used to determine the reporting irradiance.
- Updated the examples to reflect the changes to the API for data loading, column grouping, selection (loc and floc vs view and rview), and balanced reporting irradiance.
- Changed the `scatter_hv` method to be more flexible and not require temperature or wind regression columns.

### Removed
- Removed the value checking functionality of the group_columns function. Data quality is outside the scope of the pvcaptest project.
- Removed the `load_data`, `load_das`, and `load_pvsyst` methods from the CapData class. Replaced with io module.



[0.10.0]: https://github.com/pvcaptest/pvcaptest/compare/v0.9.0...v0.10.0
## [0.10.0] - 2021-07-25
### Added
- Added the filter_missing CapData method to remove missing data from specified columns.
By default removes only intervals that contain missing data in the regression variable
columns.
- Added option to filter_irr method to specify using the reporting irradiance in the CapData object as the reference irradiance.
- Added option to the filter_time method to drop the specified time period instead of dropping all other times.
- Added option to filter_clearsky method to keep time periods with unstable irradiance.
- Added new attributes to CapData: removed, kept, filter_counts. The update_summary decorator now stores the
index of points removed, the index of points remaining after each filter, and the number of times any filter has been run for each filter applied.
- Adds new plotting method, scatter_filters, which shows which filtering step removed which time intervals of data in a plot of irradiance vs. power.
- New plotting method, timeseries_filters, which shows which fitlering step removed which time intervals of data in a plot of power vs. time.
- New plotting function, overlay_scatters, that overlays irradiance vs. power scatter plots of the data remaining after the last filtering step of the two CapData objects passed to the function.
- New get_filtering_table method that returns a DataFrame documenting the which time intervals are removed by which filter and which time intervals remain after all filtering.
- Adds the run_test function, which applies the passed list of CapData filtering methods to the CapData object passed.
- Adds the points_summary method, which prints the number of points remaining after all filtering, the length of the test period, the average points remaining after filtering per day, if enough points have been collected, if
more points are needed how many, and how many days left if the rate of points holds.

### Changed
- Updated filter_pvsyst method to handle inverter output variables that have underscores
or spaces like 'IL Pmin' and 'IL_Pmin'.
- load_das method no longer drops columns and rows that contain no data
- Format of hover tooltip in plots produced by plot method now includes comma separator for thousands.
- Changes captest to pvcaptest in documentation.
- get_reg_cols method default changed to get and rename the columns defined in the `regression_cols` attribute
rather than expecting regression variables/columns to be identified by the keys 'power', 'poa', 't_amb', and 'w_vel' in the `regression_cols` attribute.


[0.9.0]: https://github.com/pvcaptest/pvcaptest/compare/v0.8.0...v0.9.0
## [0.9.0] - 2020-08-16

- Removed binder directory.
- Update readme to reflect changes to conda environment.yml
- Minor updates to example.
- Minor documentation string updates.

[0.5.1]: https://github.com/pvcaptest/pvcaptest/compare/v0.4.0...v0.5.1
## [0.5.1] - 2019-05-01
### Added
- Addition of clear sky modeling using pvlib library.  See new example notebook 'Clear Sky Examples'.
- Added a new method, `predict_capacities` for calculating reporting conditions and predicted outputs by month.
- New example notebook demonstrating use of `rep_cond` and `predict_capacities`.
- Add warning when filter removes all data.

### Changed
- Changed Holoviews dependency to >= v1.11.  DatLink added in v1.11 is required for scatter_hv method.
- Expanded docstring for the load_data method to more clearly explain how the method joins multiple files (by row).
- Update installation directions in README.
- Updated conda environment file (conda_env.yml) to match updated dependencies.
- **Moved all filtering and regression functionality from CapTest class into the CapData class and replace CapTest class with functions for results comparing CapData objects.**
- **Significant refactor of the rep\_cond function.  Removed any time filtering and prediction from rep\_cond.  Rep\_cond acts on filtered data in the df\_flt attribute.**
- `agg_sensors` method updated to be more explicit and flexible.
- Changed `filter_sensors` to filter based on percent difference between all combinations of pairs of sensors measuring the same environmental factor.  Corrected bug where standard deviation filter could not detect outliers with more than two, but still a small number of sensors.
- Adjusted bounds check of columns of data when importing so that translation dictionary names would not have 'valuesError' added to them.
- Made printout of bounds check results optional when loading data.
- Adjusted the type\_defs and sub\_type_defs, so that translation dictionary keys are more accurate for PVsyst data.
