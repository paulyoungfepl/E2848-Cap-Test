==========================================

pvcaptest is intended to facilitate capacity testing following ASTM E2848 - Standard
Test Method for Reporting Photovoltaic Non-Concentrator System Performance.
The pvcaptest package provides methods for loading, visualizing, filtering, regressing capacity
testing data, and summarizing test results. 

You can download the `presentation <https://pvpmc.sandia.gov/download/4610/>`_
introducing pvcaptest at the PVPMC modeling workshop from May, 2019.

Please see the :ref:`installation` page for installation help.

An example of a complete capacity test using pvcaptest is available in the examples
section. The examples are all produced from Jupyter notebooks and an interactive
version can be launched by clicking on the 'launch binder' button.

This project is under development with a goal of releasing a v1.0 with a stable API.
Please see the `github page <https://github.com/pvcaptest/pvcaptest>`_ for the
source code. Ongoing work is tracked in the Github projects and issues.  If you
have suggestions for improvements or find any bugs, please open an issue.
